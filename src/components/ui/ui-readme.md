# Shadcn folder /ui
 Since everything inside the /ui folder is generated via the shadcn cli, I prefer not to edit any files in this folder. I ended up renaming to fit my coding style but when I added another component, I had to rename the files again.

If you need to make changes to the UI components, you should do so in the /src/components/custom-ui folder.
